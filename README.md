### About this project:
This is a amazing project created with some codes and hard-workfull mentality, nothing else.  Combination of all fucntionlities are seems difficult, But was far easier than I think at first time. Anyway this is a `web-app` about `niche`. You can visit on this web-app here: https://savon-cdf49.web.app/ . But rememdber you cannot visit all routes because some routes are `privet-route`, you have to `login` first to visit. Dont worry about your information. Its `authenticated` with `google`  using `firebase` Thats it. All data using in this web app are hosted in `mongo db`. I used to make some api for `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` operation performs for the client side.


### Fucntionality Used -
- its a `react` application
- `react-router-dom`
- `privet/protected-route`
- `react-bootstrap-componant`
- `express`
- `mongodb`
- `material ui`
- `user dashboard`
- `admin dashboard`
- `firebase` authenticaton
- `firebase` deploy

In this web app, user can purchase desired service. He/She can also withdraw his/her request to cancel the order at the `My Orders` tab. The admin can handle all request and perform cancel any request, approve any requst at the `Manage All Orders` tab. The admin can also add package in the `Add Product` tab.
